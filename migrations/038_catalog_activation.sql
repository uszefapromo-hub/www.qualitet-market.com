-- Migration 038: Activate central-catalog products for feed ranking
--
-- Existing seeded products (migration 012) have quality_score = 0 and
-- is_featured = false, which means the feed returns them but the ranking
-- is flat.  This migration:
--
--   1. Computes a quality_score (0–100) for every active central-catalog
--      product that still has score 0, using readily-available columns.
--   2. Marks the top-scoring products as is_featured = true (at least 5).
--   3. Ensures expected_reseller_profit and recommended_reseller_price are
--      populated (idempotent back-fill matching migration 036 logic).
--
-- All statements are idempotent via WHERE guards.

-- ── 1. Back-fill profit columns if migration 036 was not yet applied ─────────
-- Note: expected_platform_profit is left NULL when supplier_price is unknown,
--       to avoid overstating profitability (platform profit = sale price minus cost).
UPDATE products

                                   THEN ROUND(platform_price - supplier_price, 2)
                                   ELSE NULL

--    +25  has a non-empty image_url
--    +20  description longer than 40 characters
--    +15  stock ≥ 50
--    +10  stock between 10 and 49
--    +15  expected_reseller_profit / platform_price ≥ 0.25 (25 % margin)
--    +10  expected_reseller_profit / platform_price ≥ 0.15 (15 % margin)
--    +15  supplier_price is set (product originates from a real supplier)
